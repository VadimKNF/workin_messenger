# workin_messenger
simple messenger

WORKS:
registration,
authorisation,
messaging (not nice),
logout.

DOESNT WORKS cuz Im lazy:
password encryption (WTF need to be added),
showing messages from database (its really bad rigth now),
if you try to registrate already existing user youll do it, cuz Im lazy (yes there will be a duplicate record in db),<br>

I know how to fix all issues, but I dont want to do it, because its a simple studyin project
