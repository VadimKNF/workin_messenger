# workin_messenger
simple messenger

WORKS:<br>
registration<br>
authorisation<br>
messaging (not nice)<br>
logout.

DOESNT WORKS cuz Im lazy:<br>
password encryption (WTF need to be added)<br>
showing messages from database (its really bad rigth now)<br>
if you try to registrate already existing user youll do it, cuz Im lazy (yes there will be a duplicate record in db)<br>

I know how to fix all issues, but I dont want to do it, because its a simple studyin project
